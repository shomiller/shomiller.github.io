I am the Hans Bethe Postdoctoral Fellow in the Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics at Cornell University. I work on a variety of topics in high-energy particle theory, with a focus on the physics of the Higgs boson, the flavor and strong CP puzzles, beyond the Standard Model physics at colliders and other experiments, and related formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Prior to arriving at Cornell, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the High Energy Theory Group at Harvard University. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2020 working in the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP) at Stony Brook University, supervised by [Patrick Meade](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~meade/). My dissertation was awarded the J. J. and Noriko Sakurai Dissertation Award in Theoretical Particle Physics in 2021. I also spent time as a visitor at Brookhaven National Laboratory, working with Sally Dawson as part of the DOE SCGSR Program. I did my undergraduate work at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where I graduated in 2015 with degrees in Physics and Mathematics.

More details about my professional career can be found in my [CV](/cv). For more information about my research, see the various pages above, or check out my publications at [<i class="ai ai-inspire"></i> Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1515880).
